* Iterators in Go

As of 2020, Go does not provide a way to implement user-defined iterators supported by the `for` `…` `range` syntax. Here are two recipes to work around this limitation:

- Implement the classic iterator pattern: an object with two methods and an internal counter. One method advances the counter, returning `false` when there are no more items. The other returns the next item. Client code uses the iterator like this:

    iterator := MyIterator(iterable)
    for iterator.Advance() {
        value := iterator.Next()
        doSomethingWith(value)
    }

- Implement an interface similar to [[https://golang.org/pkg/text/scanner/][text/scanner]].

- Implement https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/wiki/Iterator-Guidelines (https://pkg.go.dev/google.golang.org/api/iterator)

- Implement a function that spawns a coroutine to send items one by one through a channel, return that channel . Client code reads the channel using clean `for` `…` `range` syntax. This implementation is simpler. However, there is a context switch cost to run a coroutine, and the coroutine may _leak_ if it does not run to completion.

* Use of a channel-based iterator

Here is a test for a simple `PositiveIterator` that takes a slice of numbers and generates the positive, non-zero items in it, one by one:

.code -numbers iterators/channel-iter/iterator_test.go /^func Example/,/^}/
