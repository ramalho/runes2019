* What we will build

`runes`: a CLI tool to find Unicode characters by name.

    $ ./runes fire
    U+2632	☲	TRIGRAM FOR FIRE
    U+2EA3	⺣	CJK RADICAL FIRE
    U+2F55	⽕	KANGXI RADICAL FIRE
    U+322B	㈫	PARENTHESIZED IDEOGRAPH FIRE
    U+328B	㊋	CIRCLED IDEOGRAPH FIRE
    U+4DDD	䷝	HEXAGRAM FOR THE CLINGING FIRE
    U+1F525	🔥	FIRE
    U+1F692	🚒	FIRE ENGINE
    U+1F6F1	🛱	ONCOMING FIRE ENGINE
    U+1F702	🜂	ALCHEMICAL SYMBOL FOR FIRE
    10 characters found


* How `runes` works

The [[https://home.unicode.org/][Unicode Consortium]] maintains the [[http://www.unicode.org/ucd/][Unicode Character Database]] (UCD).

One of the files in the UCD is [[https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt][UnicodeData.txt]] — a list with names for > 32.000 characters.

`UnicodeData.txt` looks like this:

    0037;DIGIT SEVEN;Nd;0;EN;;7;7;7;N;;;;;
    0038;DIGIT EIGHT;Nd;0;EN;;8;8;8;N;;;;;
    0039;DIGIT NINE;Nd;0;EN;;9;9;9;N;;;;;
    003A;COLON;Po;0;CS;;;;;N;;;;;
    003B;SEMICOLON;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
    003C;LESS-THAN SIGN;Sm;0;ON;;;;;Y;;;;;
    003D;EQUALS SIGN;Sm;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
    003E;GREATER-THAN SIGN;Sm;0;ON;;;;;Y;;;;;
    003F;QUESTION MARK;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
    0040;COMMERCIAL AT;Po;0;ON;;;;;N;;;;;
    0041;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;0061;
    0042;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;0062;
    0043;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C;Lu;0;L;;;;;N;;;;0063;


* Getting character names from Go

The semi-official package [[https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/text/unicode/runenames][runenames]] provides a single function `Name` returning the character name of the given `rune`.

.play -edit assets/name.go


* Beginning TDD

* First test: an example test

Source: `github.com/standupdev/runes2019/chapter01/runes011/...`

.code runes011/main_test.go

To run, go where that file is saved. Then:

    $ go test
    # github.com/standupdev/runes2019/chapter01/runes [...]
    ./main_test.go:4:2: undefined: main
    FAIL	github.com/standupdev/runes2019/chapter01/runes [build failed]

* First test passing

.code runes011/main_test.go

.code runes011/main.go

Run the test:

    $ go test
    PASS
    ok  	github.com/standupdev/runes2019/chapter01/runes	0.006s

* Lab 1.1

*1.* Create a directory named `…/go/src/wtm-runes/lab01`

*2.* In `lab01/`, create `main_test.go` with the code shown in the previous slide.

*3.* Run `go test`. Make sure the error message is what you expect.

*4.* Create `main.go` with the code shown in the previous slide.

*5.* Run `go test`. The test should pass.

*6.* Browse these references:

- [[https://blog.golang.org/examples][The Go Blog: Testable Examples in Go]]
- *Examples* section in the [[https://golang.org/pkg/testing/#hdr-Examples][testing package documentation]]


* Go syntax

* Basic source file structure

.code runes011/main.go

- Every Go source file must start with a `package` declaration; `package` `main` is conventionally used for a stand-alone program (as opposed to a library).

- Next is usually `import`, naming libraries as simple strings or repository paths.

- Functions start with `func`, followed by an identifier, an optional list of arguments in parenthesis, and an optional list of return types. The opening `{` must be in that same line. Soon we'll see how to declare arguments and return types.

* Short variable declarations

Go is a statically typed language, but it implements a simple form of _type_inference_. This avoids repetitive declarations such as this example from a ficticious language:

    EnterpriseSingletonFactoryFactory e = new EnterpriseSingletonFactoryFactory();

To leverage type inference, use the `:=` operator to make the first assignment to a new variable in the source code. This is called a _short_variable_declaration_. 

    func main() {
        n := 20                // int is the default type of integer literals
        result := Factorial(n) // result will match the return type of Factorial
        fmt.Println("Largest factorial that fits an int:")
        fmt.Printf("\t%d! = %d\n", n, result)
    }

The compiler _infers_ (guesses) the type of the variable from the right-hand expression. 

Further assigments to the same variable in the same scope must use `=` (not `:=`), and cannot change the type of the variable.

* Default types of constant literals

.play -edit assets/defaultypes.go

* Zero value of flat types

I call types that are not pointers and have no embedded pointers _flat_types_.

.play -edit assets/zerovalues.go

* The `rune` type

- The character type in Go is `rune`, an alias for `int32`.

- The constant literal `0x2108` is an `int`.

- To code a `rune` literal using that character code you have write it as `\u2108`.

- You can get a `rune` from an `int` (with 32 bits or less) with `rune(myInt)`

* A few different ways to display a `rune`

.play -edit assets/int2rune.go

Read about _formatting_verbs_ `%T`, `%v`, `%q` etc. in the [[https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/][`fmt` package documentation]].


* Second test

    func Example_report() {
        report("scruple")
        // Output:
        // U+2108	℈	SCRUPLE
        // 1 character found
    }

The report lists characters with three fields, separated by tabs:

- Character _codepoint_ as `U+` followed by 4, 5 or 6 hexadecimal digits;
- The character;
- Name of the character, all uppercase.

Last line of the report shows count of characters found, or "no character found".

*NOTE:* The word "scruple" appears only once in `UnicodeData.txt`. Scruple is an old weight measurement ≅ 1.3g.

* Lab 1.2

*1.* Add the `Example_report` test to `main_test.go`.

*2.* Run `go test`. Is the error message what you expected?

*3.* Edit `main.go` to make the test pass. Don't implement any logic or formatting yet; just hard-code the printed string to make the test pass.

*4.* Edit the `report` function creating three variables: `char`, `name`, `count` with suitable values. Use `fmt.Printf` to build each line of the report to make the test pass.

*Tips*

- The new function will have the signature below (we will change that later):

  func report(word string) {

- Use the `runenames.Name(char)` function get the name of the `rune`. Recall the different ways to show a rune we saw before.

* Lab 1.2 solution

.code runes012/main.go

* Creating a struct type

* Our CharName struct

The `runes` app will scan the Unicode Character Database (UCD) and select characters that have the desired words in their name.

The essential unit of data in this process is a pair made of a character and its name.

In Go, we can represent such a pair with a struct type, declared like this:

    type CharName struct {
        Char rune
        Name string
    }

*NOTE*: the names of public types, fields, and functions must start with an uppercase letter. This is not just a convention, it is enforced by the Go compiler.

Go does not have "classes", but we can attach methods to types, which then behave like classes (but without inheritance). We'll do that next.

* Lab 1.3: A printable struct, part 1/3

*1.* Add this struct declaration to `runes/main.go`:

    type CharName struct {
        Char rune
        Name string
    }


*2.* Add these imports to `runes/main_test.go`:

    import (
        "fmt"
        "testing"
    )

The `testing` package from the Go standard library supports testing for correctness and performance (benchmarking).

(lab continues...)

* Lab 1.3: A printable struct, part 2/3

*3.* Add this test to `runes/main_test.go`:

.code -numbers runes013/main_test.go /^func Test_CharName_String/,/^}/

- the `t` argument is a pointer to a `T` struct that provides several methods for running tests and reporting errors.

- `fmt.Sprint` implicitly invokes a `String` method on its argument(s).

- `t.Errorf` marks the test as failing and logs the error.

(lab continues...)


* Lab 1.3: A printable struct, part 3/3

*3.* To pass the test in the previous slide, add a `String` method after the `CharName` struct in `main.go`. The method should have the signature shown below. Use a `fmt.Sprintf` call to build the string, similar to the `fmt.Printf` call already present in the `report` function.

    func (cn CharName) String() string {
        // return a string like this: U+XXXX<tab>Y<tab>NAME OF CHARACTER Y
    }

*NOTE*: In contrast with functions, method signatures declare the receiver object as a special argument in parenthesis right after the `func` keyword.

In the example above, `cn` plays the role of the special variable `this` in Java or `self` in Python.

*4.* Check that the test passes.

* End of chapter 1 🎉
