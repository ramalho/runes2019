* Variable models in languages

.image 05/varmodels-languages.png

Unlike Python, Go allows `nil` references.

Some Go reference variables hold more than a pointer.
For example, a slice variable holds a hidden struct with three fields.

* Reference types

- string
- pointer
- map
- slice
- channel¬π
- function¬π
- interface¬π

¬π Not covered in this chapter

* Pointers

* Pointers

Go has managed pointers:

- There is no pointer arithmetic.

- Memory is allocated by `make()`, `new()`, literals, and assignments (which copy).

- Memory is deallocated by the garbage collector.

 Note: the `unsafe` package breaks all the rules, allowing arbitrary memory access.
 It's mostly used for low-level interfacing with external libraries and... is not safe!


* Pointer syntax

Basic pointer syntax is similar to C.

.play -edit 05/pointers/student.go

* Struct as function parameter

ü§î What is wrong? And why?

.play -edit 05/pointers/student_func_wrong.go

* Struct pointer as function parameter

Fixed:

.play -edit 05/pointers/student_func_ok.go

* Method with struct receiver

ü§î What is wrong? And why?

.play -edit 05/pointers/student_method_wrong.go

* Method with pointer receiver

Note: no need to use `&` when invoking `s.addCredits()` in this example. [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9958064/go-syntax-of-calling-a-function-with-pointer-receiver][(explanation)]]

.play -edit 05/pointers/student_method_ok.go

* Strings

* Strings

- String data is immutable in Go.

- A string variable holds a hidden struct with two fields: the current length and a pointer to the string in the heap.

- `len(s)` returns the value of the hidden `length` field.

- Passing strings to functions is efficient: only two machine words are copied.

- `nil` cannot be assigned to string variables.

* Memory layout of strings

.play -edit 05/strings/inspect.go /^func main/,/^}/

`inspectString()` uses `unsafe` package to access arbitrary memory. [[https://github.com/ramalho/runes2020/blob/75c7fe97d7e92923f76f8e01b838ef622aa45fa0/05/strings/inspect.go#L9][(source)]]

* Strings as parameters: function must return a new string

.play -edit 05/strings/replace.go

* Evil example: pointers as parameters

üö® Pointer parameters can change bindings in-place‚Äîeven for immutable values!

.play -edit 05/pointers/replace_in_place.go

* Evil example: pointers as parameters (2)

.play -edit 05/pointers/replace_in_place_2.go

* Maps

* Using a map

.play -edit 05/maps/get_element.go

* Building maps

.play -edit 05/maps/make_map.go

Maps grow dinamically: calling `make()` with initial size is an optimization.

Note: `m0` is a nil map!

* Maps as parameters

‚ÄúLike slices, maps hold references to an underlying data structure.‚Äù [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#maps][(Effective Go)]]

.play -edit 05/maps/param_map.go

* Nil maps cannot store values

.play -edit 05/maps/nil_map.go

üö® nil maps: reading returns zero value, but assigning to a key panics!

Use literal syntax `map[K]V{}` or `make(map[K]V)` to build usable maps.

* Slices

* Building slices

.play -edit 05/slices/make.go

Calling `make()` with `len` and `cap` is an optimization.

Slices can grow beyond `cap` with `append`: it may allocate a new underlying array.

* Using slices

.play -edit 05/slices/months.go

Based on example from [[http://www.gopl.io/][GOPL]], section 4.2‚ÄîSlices.

* Three overlapping slices, one underlying array

.image 05/overlapping-slices.png

Figure 4.1 from [[http://www.gopl.io/][GOPL]].

* Slices as parameters

üö® ‚ÄúSlices hold references to an underlying array, and if you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array.‚Äù [[https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#slices][(Effective Go)]]

.play -edit 05/slices/change_items.go

* Safer: create new slice

.play -edit 05/slices/change_items_safe.go

* Safer, optimized: copy slice before updating

.play -edit 05/slices/change_items_safe_2.go

* Different example, also safe: create new slice with changes

.play -edit 05/slices/safe_remove.go

* Cheaper and faster, but dangerous: change slice in-place

.play -edit 05/slices/fast_remove.go

Based on example from [[http://www.gopl.io/][GOPL]], section 4.2.2‚ÄîIn-Place Slice Techniques

* make()

* make() exists to build objects of 3 kinds

maps

    m0 := make(map[int]string)      // map with "small starting size"
    m1 := make(map[int]string, 10)  // sized to hold at least 10 items

slices

    s0 := make([]int, 0)           // same as:  s0 := []int{}
    s1 := make([]int, 10)          // len = 10; cap = 10
    s2 := make([]int, 10, 10_000)  // len = 10; cap = 10,000

channels

    c0 := make(chan int)          // unbuffered channel
    c1 := make(chan int, 10_000)  // channel with buffer for 10,000 items
